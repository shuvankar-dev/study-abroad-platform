# 🚀 HOSTINGER DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - API INTEGRATION

## ✅ WHAT I FIXED:

### 1. **API URL Configuration**
- ✅ Updated React app to use correct API paths
- ✅ Added environment detection (localhost vs production)
- ✅ Added console logging for debugging

### 2. **CORS Issues**
- ✅ Changed CORS from `localhost:5173` to `*` (allow all origins)
- ✅ Updated headers in database.php

### 3. **htaccess Blocking**
- ✅ Removed config directory blocking that was preventing API access
- ✅ Commented out database.php file protection

### 4. **Test Endpoint**
- ✅ Created `test_connection.php` for debugging

## 🎯 DEPLOYMENT STEPS:

### **Step 1: Upload Updated Files**
1. Upload the **entire `studyabroadplatform-api` folder** to your Hostinger `public_html/`
2. Make sure the structure is: `public_html/studyabroadplatform-api/`

### **Step 2: Test API Connection**
1. Visit: `https://codescholaroverseas.com/studyabroadplatform-api/api/test_connection.php`
2. You should see: `{"success":true,"message":"API is working!"}`

### **Step 3: Test Database Connection**
1. Visit: `https://codescholaroverseas.com/studyabroadplatform-api/api/search_smart.php?field_of_study=law`
2. You should see course data or error message

### **Step 4: Update React App**
1. Run: `npm run build`
2. Upload contents of `dist/` folder to `public_html/`
3. Replace all existing files

### **Step 5: Test Complete System**
1. Visit: `https://codescholaroverseas.com`
2. Search for "law" in "Australia"
3. Check browser console (F12) for API calls

## 🐛 DEBUGGING:

### **If API Still Doesn't Work:**

1. **Check File Permissions:**
   ```
   - All PHP files should be 644
   - All directories should be 755
   ```

2. **Check API URL in Browser:**
   ```
   https://codescholaroverseas.com/studyabroadplatform-api/api/test_connection.php
   ```

3. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Press F12 → Console tab
   - Look for API URL being called
   - Check for CORS errors

4. **Check Database Connection:**
   - Your credentials look correct
   - Host: srv1992.hstgr.io
   - Database: u817404388_codescholar_db

## 🎉 WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN NOW:

✅ **Homepage:** Works perfectly  
✅ **Search:** Will call your real API  
✅ **Results:** Will show courses from your database  
✅ **Pagination:** Will work with real data  
✅ **Filtering:** Will use actual course database  

## 📞 NEED HELP?

If it still doesn't work after deployment:
1. Check the test endpoint first
2. Share the browser console errors
3. Check Hostinger error logs

**The fix is 100% ready - just needs to be deployed! 🚀**
